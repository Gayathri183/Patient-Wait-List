# Patient Waitlist Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of healthcare patient waitlist data using Power BI. It focuses on breaking down waitlist information by specialty group, case type (inpatient, day case, outpatient), and patient age profiles. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions to reduce backlog and improve care delivery.

## Features
- Total waitlist summary (25 million+ cases)
- Comparative metrics for latest and previous month
- Age profile distribution (0–15, 16–64, 65+)
- Specialty-wise and time-based breakdown
- Interactive filtering with slicers (date, case type, specialty, age group)
- Historical trends from Jan 2018 to Mar 2021

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI
- Excel
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Insights
- Outpatient cases contribute to the largest share of the backlog.
- Vascular Surgery and Urology are key areas with long wait times.
- Age group 16–64 experiences the most delay.
- A significant number of records have missing specialty data, requiring further cleaning.
